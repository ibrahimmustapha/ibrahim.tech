Computer programming is not just knowing the syntax of a programming language like Java or Python, there's more and the almighty big O is no exception. 

 
## What is big O notation?

Big O notation is used to calculate how much time and space it takes an algorithms to be executed as input size grows ``(in computer science).``


## Big O notation basically talks about 2 (two) things:

1. **Time Complexity**
2. **Space Complexity**


## Space Complexity

Space Complexity 
Space complexity in simple words is the amount of memory required by an algorithm ``(computer program)`` to be executed. 

Space complexity doesnâ€™t really matter this days due how cheap computer memory has become. Time is more important these days.


## Time Complexity

Time complexity is the amount of time it takes an ``algorithm`` to run or be executed. Below are the 5 popular time complexities in big â€“ notation.

- O (1)  -  Constant time
- O (log n)  - Logarithmic time
- O (n)  -  Linear time
- O (n log n)  -  Log-linear time
- O (n^2)  -  Quadratic


## An Example of an algorithm to make coffee to explain the concept better

- Pour hot water in a mug
- Pour coffee into a mug
- ``Fetch sugar with a spoon``
- ``Pour the sugar in to the tea``
- Repeat steps 3 and 4 until youâ€™ve added the desired amount of sugar.

Looking at the algorithm above, the more the sugar the larger the algorithm grows 


| Amount of Sugar | Steps Involded |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| 1 spoon         | 4 steps        |
| 2 spoon         | 6 steps        |
| 3 spoon         | 8 steps        |


## How to Calculate the time complexity of the algorithm above (**with the example above**)

Number of desired sugar = n
Total number of steps =  2n + 2

The two in front of the n is the steps 3 and 4 (which is 2 steps)  and the other 2 is steps 1 and 2. This means, steps 1 and 2 are constant steps because they do not change no matter the input size(which  is sugar). 

The ``(n)`` represents the desired amount of sugar which changes depending on the who is taking the coffee. In this case, the time complexity of the alogirith above is O(n) which is Linear Time Complexity. 

> **Note:**
> <mark>*The time complexity of an algorithm is determined by the worst case scenario.*</mark>


## Why Linear Time Complexity
In linear time complexity, the algorithm grows directly proportional to the size of the input data. 

The more input size grows, the more time it takes to execute the algorithm which makes it a linear time complexity. Just like this â¬‡


| Amount of Sugar | Steps Involded |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| 1 spoon         | 4 steps        |
| 2 spoon         | 6 steps        |
| 3 spoon         | 8 steps        |


## Letâ€™s talk about some of the types of time complexities down hereâ¬‡

### Constant Time Complexity O(1)
If it takes an algorithm the same amount of time to be executed regardless of the size of the input data, 

it is referred to as a constant time complexity ``O(1)``.  This is by far the best time complexity.

### Linear Time Complexity O(n)
In linear time complexity, the algorithm grows directly proportional to the size of the input data. 

This means, the more input size grows, the more time it takes to execute the algorithm.

### Quadratic Time Complexity O(n^2)
In quadratic time complexity, the algorithm grows directly proportional to twice the size of the input data.

## Hereâ€™s a graph to demonstrate the time complexities mentioned above
