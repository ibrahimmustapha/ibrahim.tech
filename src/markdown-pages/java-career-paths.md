You probably learnt the basics of java, wrote some excellent programs but realized you couldn't make anything in the real world with your knowledge. 

After learning the basics of a programming language most code newbies don't know what path to dive into. Here are five career paths you can dive into after learning the basics of java. 

# What is Java in the first place?

``Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.`` Java was created by **James Gosling** and his team at sun micro systems. Java was first released in the year 1995. Now back to the paths down here.


## 1. Android Development

Android application development is the process of developing applications that are compatible with devices that run the android operating system. 

``Android apps can be developed with Java, Kotlin, c++.`` Check the android java documentation in the link below to get started.

## 2. Web Development

``Java can be used to develop web application mostly for the server side or back-end.``

There are tons of java web frameworks you can learn. **A few examples include spring boot, apache spark, spark java and many among others**. Check out the link below for the spring framework documentation.

## 3. Game Development

Java can also be used to develop games mostly for android with libraries like LibGDX etc. Myself I haven't developed any game with Java yet but I'm looking forward to doing that. 

The link below is a udemy course to get you started with game development in Java.

## 4. DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. 

``With the knowledge of Java you can dive into devops as well. Below is a course for you to get your hands dirty.``

## 5. Desktop Application Development

Java can also come be used to develop desktop applications as well. There are few desktop application frameworks I know of i.e JavaFX , swing etc. Course for Java desktop app development.
